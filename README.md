# Data-Analysis-for-Bakery-Dataset
Basic data analysis is performed on a bakery dataset. The EDA and market basket analysis provides insights into the bakery's sales and how the information can be used to form strategies to optimize products sold thus increasing the sales.

Source of the dataset: Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulmansarwar/transactions-from-a-bakery?resource=download

TASK- Following questions are to be answered:
1. Combination of which 2 items will increase the sales on a regular basis?
2. At what time of the day are the sales most influential? (consider the complete data for answering this question) 
3. If you had to replace an item from the servings, which would it be and why?
4. If you had to add wine to one particular hour of the day, at what time would it be?

The DA_Code.R file conists the R Code for the analysis.

The BakeryDataset_DA.pdf document consits of the answers and results to the above questions.
